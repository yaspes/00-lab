##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I had a hard indentifying what is suppose to go into modules and what is suppose to be in layout stylesheet. In the layout file, I included the nav, aside and footer. I think I have too much stuff in my layout page, I'm pretty sure I need to implement some of those rules into the modules stylesheet.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I just refactored the print and date classes in modules so that they each have a seperate ruleset. I'm not sure if that was a good move, I just feel like its easier to have seperate access to them.
